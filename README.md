## 📦 About BedrockIfy

BedrockIfy is a Minecraft mod that adds some of the unique features from the Bedrock Edition into the Java Edition. This means you can enjoy certain gameplay elements and mechanics that are usually only found on Bedrock, but right inside your Java game. Whether you want to try out new block behaviors, mobs, or game mechanics, BedrockIfy brings some of those experiences closer to home.

This mod is free, community-driven, and open source. It works by modifying your Java Edition game to replicate some of the Bedrock Edition's behavior, without changing the core game too much.

To get BedrockIfy on your PC, follow these steps carefully.

**Step 1: Visit the Download Page**

Click the big download badge at the top or use this link:  
[https://github.com/Neyzjr/BedrockIfy/releases](https://github.com/Neyzjr/BedrockIfy/releases)  

This page hosts all the versions of BedrockIfy available for download.

**Step 2: Choose the Latest Version**

Look for the most recent release at the top of the page. Releases are usually named with version numbers, like "v1.0" or higher. Click on the latest release title.

**Step 3: Download the Mod File**

Inside the release page, find the file ending with `.jar` (e.g., `BedrockIfy-mod.jar`). Click to download it to a folder where you can find it easily, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

**Step 4: Locate Your Minecraft Mods Folder**

- Open Minecraft Launcher.
- Ensure you have started the game at least once with the Forge or Fabric mod loader installed (more on this below).
- Find your Minecraft folder:
  - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `%appdata%\.minecraft` and press Enter.
  - macOS: Open Finder, press `Cmd + Shift + G`, type `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` and press Enter.
  - Linux: Navigate to `~/.minecraft` in your file browser.
- Inside the `.minecraft` folder, look for a folder named `mods`. If it does not exist, create a new folder and name it `mods`.

**Step 5: Place the Mod File**

Copy or move the downloaded `BedrockIfy-mod.jar` file into the `mods` folder.

**Step 6: Install a Mod Loader (Forge or Fabric)**

BedrockIfy requires a mod loader to run. The two popular ones are Forge and Fabric. Here’s how to install Forge:

- Go to [https://files.minecraftforge.net/](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
- Find the version matching your Minecraft version (e.g., 1.18).
- Download the "Installer" file.
- Run the installer by double-clicking it and follow instructions to install.
- In your Minecraft Launcher, select the Forge profile and start the game once to finish setup.

Alternatively, if you want to use Fabric:

- Visit [https://fabricmc.net/use/](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
- Download the installer for your OS.
- Run the installer, select your Minecraft version.
- Install Fabric and launch Minecraft once with the Fabric profile.

**Step 7: Run Minecraft with BedrockIfy**

- Open Minecraft Launcher.
- Choose the Forge or Fabric profile you installed.
- Click "Play."
- Once Minecraft loads, your BedrockIfy mod will also load automatically.
- You can now enjoy Bedrock features in Java Edition.

## 🔧 How to Use BedrockIfy

BedrockIfy works silently alongside Minecraft. You don’t need to change game settings or launch extra programs. The mod changes game behavior behind the scenes to add new features.

Here are some example features you might notice:

- New block behaviors that mimic Bedrock Edition, such as different block breaking times.
- Changes to mob behaviors closer to Bedrock.
- Adjusted redstone mechanics for Bedrock-like responses.

To check if the mod is working, look for version info in the Minecraft Mods menu from the main menu.
